    <section class = "Intro" id = "nmc-intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I will highlight key points of the run starting with the Skeleton tutorial room</p>
        <p>This won't be a room by room guide since watching a run will probably better explain the movement in each room</p>
        <p>For further information regarding the first two rooms of the game, visit the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#tutorialSegment">tutorial</a> section</p>
    </section>

    <section class = "Skeleton" id = "SkeletonRoom">
        <h2>Ecclesia - Skeleton Tutorial Room</h2>
        <p>As mentioned in the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#skeleRoom">Skeleton Room Info</a> section, we want to force the Skeletons to spawn in front of Shanoa</p>
        <p>In NMC, we pick up a Heart Max Up in the Monastery, so we can use all of our Unions here</p>
        <p><b>Get a single jump slash on the first Skeleton, then do a grounded Union close to it, hitting the second one as well</b></p>
        <p>If done right, 2 more will spawn infront of Shanoa, and you repeat the sequence</p>
        <p>The key here is how close you do the Union to the Skeletons and remaining grounded as you do</p>
        <p>If done in the air, the Union will miss or cancel early, and if done far away, less of it will hit</p>
        <p>Just make sure you're not too close to the first Skeleton or you risk triggering a spawn behind you</p>

    <section class = "eccMon" id = "eccMon">
        <h2>Monastery</h2>
        <p>Confedere Cancel out of the Skeleton Room and slide off the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#generalInfo">ledges/jump</a> to cancel your fall end lag to exit Ecclesia</p>
        <p>Confedere Cancel through the entrance of the Monastery, near the end of the outside area you'll run out of MP so use <a href ="../General/Gen.html#backdashSection">other forms of BDC</a>.</p>

        <h3>Monastery Skeleton Room</h3>
        <p>If the first Skeleton throws a bone, jump above it then <a href = "../General/Gen.html#damageBoost">damage boost</a> off the bone to get knocked past it</p>
        <p>BDC to the next Skeleton and damage boost off of it then jump over the next</p>
        <p>Finally, damage boost off the next Skeleton's bone or body to get through the end of the room</p>
        <p>It is RNG if they throw a bone at the right time or not, so be prepared to alternate between what you're boosting off</p>
        <img src = "MonasterySkeletonRoom.gif" alt = "Monastery Skeleton Room GIF"/>

        <h3 id = "ticketDetails">Magical Ticket</h3>
        <p>Make sure to open <em>Brown Chests</em> for a <a href = "../General/Gen.html#TicketGlitch">Magical Ticket</a></p>
        <p><em>Always go for</em> the one in the Vertical Room since getting it from this Chest saves time on this entire segment</p>
        <p>If you see a <em>Green Chest</em> go for it as well, as it can contain a <b>Heart Refresh</b>, which saves time later in the run</p>
        <p>According to hellagels, Brown Chests have a <b>22.45%</b> chance to drop a Ticket</p>
        <p>Across the usual 3 Chests we grab, this equates to a <b>53.4%</b> chance roughly to at least get <em>1</em></p>
        <p><b></b>TODO: ADD PICTURES OF THE CHESTS AND TICKET PERCENT DETAIL PICTURES</p>
        <img src = "ticketDetails.png"/>

        <h3>Magnes</h3>
        <p>Proceed through until the Magnes room as the run does</p>
        <p>If any <b>Skeleton Jumps</b> as you approach or slide through it, get hit by them for a good <em>damage boost</em></p>
        <p id = "magnesJump">After absorbing Magnes, it's <em>faster to <b>jump to cling on to the pin above you</b>, then launch Shanoa from there</em> </p>
        <p>For the second launch to the exit, I like to <b>slightly pull back down and left</b> before launching Shanoa to get to the room transition</p>
        <img src = "MagnesRoom.gif" alt = "Magnes Room GIF"/>
        <p><a href = "../General/Gen.html#magnes">Magnes Dash</a> through the zombie room, damage boosting off zombies as you proceed</p>

        <h3>Rest of Monastery</h3>
        <p>We want to pick up the <b>Heart Max Up</b> from the secret room accessed by breaking the <em>top left wall</em> in the Gold Chest room</p>
        <p>Every enemy in the Heart Max Up Room has an RNG spawn, so do your best to damage boost off the Ghosts and Zombies</p>
        <p>Continue right through the area. In the next <em>Vertical Room</em>, if you <b>do not have a Ticket or if it's a Green Chest, go for the chest</b></p>
        <p>I like to jump slash the first two bats then Slide to the chest, be mindful to not backdash <em>into</em> the bat as you leave the section</p>
        <p>As you ascend, grab the <b>Money Bag</b>. The bat shouldn't hit you if you <em>backdash jump</em> over it and land on the bag</p>
        <p>Continue left, using the Zombies and Skeletons to damage boost, and grab the Chest on the way</p>
        <p>Note: if you're getting really unlucky, you can instead quickly go <em>right</em> for another chest, but this is very slow</p>
        <p><b>TODO: ADD A PICTURE OF THE BREAKABLE WALL AND A GIF OF THE CHEST GRAB AND MONEY GRAB</b></p>
        

        <h3>Arthroverta</h2>
        <p>We're going to <em>skip</em> the <b>MP Max Up</b> before the boss</p>
        <p>At the start of the fight <b>I like to jump slash into Arthro</b></p>
        <p>After, if you take a look at the <em>background</em> you want to position yourself infront of Arthro at about the <em>center</em> of that second pillar </p>
        <img src = "ArthrovertaFight.png" alt = "Arthroverta Fight Positioning"/>
        <p>From this position, when you do a <em>Grounded Union</em>, it will hit <b>4 times</b></p>
        <p>The strategy is to <b>Union -> Couple Normal Hits -> Repeat Until 0 Hearts</b><em> before the first roll</em></p>
        <p>Afterwards, spam Confedere until Arthro dies. I like to stand a bit away when landing normal hits, to give room for a <em>slide under the Green Web attack</em></p>
        <p>Also, if you dodge away, it's good practice to close the distance with a <em>jump slash in</em></p>
        <p>Important: when she does her <em>Claw Slam</em>, you can hit her claws too</p>
        <p>Below is the general idea for the fight: </p>
        <img src = "ArthrovertaFightStrategy.png" alt = "Arthroverta Fight Strategy"/>
        <p>If you are struggling to get all your Unions in before the first roll, it's completely fine to space them out after</p>
        <p>Just be mindful to positon yourself close enough to get 4 Union hits in and not take damage</p>

        <h3>Leaving Monastery</h2>
        <p>After the fight, Magnetize on the <b>left pin and hold right</b>. The boss orb will spawn on you</p>
        <p>Hold <em>left</em> after you grab it, <b>release -> land on the right ledge -> immediately slide into the next room</b></p>
        <p>As pointed out to me by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BrookeSpeedruns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LonelySR</a>, sliding into the Albus Cutscene, then skipping the scene stops Shanoa from walking away from the left exit</p>
        <img src="AlbusCutscene.png" alt="Albus Cutscene"/>
        <p>Do the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#instantFling">Instant Flings</a> while exiting left through the boss room</p>
        <p>Go down <b>to the save -> save the game -> then suspend the game</b> to go back to the title screen</p>
        <p>The next section is where this run majorly diverges from Glitchless</p>
    </section>

    <section id = "bossRushOne" class = "bossRushOne">
        <h2>Initiating Ticket Glitch</h2>
        <p>After the suspend, go to boss rush and select <em>Course 1</em></p>
        <b>Important: Suspending is faster in the Japanese version as it does not ask for English or French, this saves less than 5 seconds through the whole run</b>
        <p>Once in <em>Course 1</em>, perform the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#TicketGlitch">Ticket Glitch</a> immediately</p>
        <p>This will take you to the Village where you want to <em>Save the Game</em></p>
        <p>Use the <em>Dominus Collection Menu</em> to reset the game then load the <em>Main Save</em></p>
        <p>We have just skipped leaving the Monastery normally AND Shanoa is now Level 50 for the rest of the run</p>
        <p>Refresh to <b>30 Hearts</b>, save the Villager, and go to Ruvas Forest</p>
    </section>

    <section id = "ruvasForest" class = "ruvasForest">
        <h1>TODO ADD VIDEOS FOR THESE TWO SEGMENTS</h1>
        <h2>Ruvas Forest</h2>
        <p>This is the biggest test of proper Damage Boosting and Magnes Dashing for each run</p>
        <p>I highly recommend watching any of the top three runs do this segment for a better idea, and I will include a video below</p>
        <p>Dash through and Damage Boost off Skeleton Knights until the <b>Torch after the Macir Statue</b>, hitting the statue on the way</p>
        <p>Before the Statue, you can also boost off the <em>Une</em> to get i-frames a bit earlier</p>
        <p>Kill the <em>Nominion (Squid)</em> if it's close and absorb Macir, refreshing you to <b>50 hearts</b></p>
        <p>Video of this: </p>
        <p>From there, watch the video guides/runs to figure out which enemies are best to damage boost off of, but I will list important boosts</p>
        <p>Generally, you want to boost off <em>Necromancers, Skeleton Knights, Axe Armors and Zombies</em></p>
        <p>In the second room, boost off the <em>bat</em> to skip through the 3 Zombies at the start</p>
        <p>You can damage boost off the bones the Skeletons throw, but if RNG is not in your favor, it can lose time so slide through</p>
        <p>Video of this: </p>
        <p>In room three, the <em>first Necromancer</em> gives you i-frames usually until you're inside the next <em>Skeleton Knight after the Une</em></p>
        <p>While in that Knight's hitbox, <b>you can jump to instantly get hit in the air</b></p>
        <p>Video of this:</p>
        <p>Boost through the best you can after until the end and head into Kalidus Channel</p>
        <p>Below is the full segment: </p>

        <p>Also be mindful of your MP here, use <a href = "../General/Gen.html#backdashSection">alternate forms of backdashing</a> when running out</p>
    </section>

    <section id = "kalidusChannel" class = "kalidusChannel">
        <h2>Kalidus Channel</h2>
        <p>A recent discovery showed that you can <b>dive kick after jumping out of the waterline</b> here to move through a bit faster</p>
        <p>Here's a video of that: </p>
        <p>I don't recommend doing this in rooms with infinitely respawn <em>Sea Stingers (Fish)</em> or ones with Needles as you lose time getting hit</p>
        <p>The general strat here is to <b>jump slash</b> to one shot any <em>Merman</em> here and damage boost off of Needles</p>
        <p>Backdash jump off the boxes and planks as you land on them</p>
        <p>Usually, you're damage boosting off Needles when there's <b>two right next to each other</b> in the <em>room before the save</em></p>
        <p>Here's the same room: </p>
        <p>Make sure to absorb the shopkeeper, bringing you to <b>60 Hearts</b></p>
        <p>You can take the heal in the middle if you want, but we're about to get two free heals so I don't recommend it</p>
        <p>After the save, continue the same movement you've been doing, and if RNG permits, you can even damage boost of <em>the fish</em> for extra speed</p>
        <p>The final room with the <em>Single Merman</em> is where I tend to use the aforementioned<b> Water Divekick Trick</b> since there's nothing else that will hit you</p>
        <p>Here's the full segment: </p>
    </section>

    <section id = "prison" class = "prison">
        <h2>Minera Prison Island</h2>
        <p>I'll split this segment's videos into 3 short parts then a final full one at the end</p>
        <p>Once you reach the boss door, equip <b>Macir on both hands</b>, also, you can <b>press Start to instantly leave the equip or item menu</b></p>
        <p>Do 4x <a href = "../General/Gen.html#unionCancel">Macir Union Cancels</a> to kill Giant Skeleton</p>
        <p>It should be fast enough to where the Orb spawns below the Magnes Pin, so you can grab it while Magentized then launch yourself to the exit  </p>
        <p>Next two rooms you want to damage boost off of the <em>Spear Guards</em> and <em>Skeleton Archers</em></p>
        <p>Important to note for the Spear Guards is that sometimes they can <em>thrust their Spears up</em>, causing heavy knockback if it hits you <br>
        To avoid this, <b>slow down your backdashes as you approach them then jump over and get hit like normal</b></p>
        <p>Also, usually an <em>Evil Force (Giant Head)</em> spawns, which is a useful damage boost as it flies low to the ground, so you can just <b>shorthop into it without turning around for i-frames</b></p>
        <p>In the following rooms, <b>backdash jump</b> up any stairs, <b>slide through the enemies in the inner hallways</b>, and <b>backdash/slide off any ledeges</b> in descending rooms</p>
        <p>There's a <em>Skeleton Archer</em> in the first descending room. If you hear it <em>drawing its bow</em> wait on the <b>raised platform</b>, otherwise keep going</p>
        <p>Video up until this point: </p>
    
        <p>Damage boost off the <em>Spear Guard through the Invisible Man</em><b> <br>Ignore the HP Max Up</b> and damage boost off of the Archers in the <em>Guillotine Room</em> to get to Albus</p>
        <p>In the Albus Room, backdash to the <b>second to last tile on the ground, then absorb the glyph</b> don't go too far or you trigger some text</p>
        <p>Backdash out of that room and <b>through the first Iron Maiden, sliding under the second one</b> before <b>grabbing the Money at the end</b></p>
        <p>Ascend, and in the next room, damage boost off the <em>Invisible Man</em> to backdash through the <em>Creature</em></p>
        <p>Use <b>jump attacks as you ascend with Macir</b> to one shot the <em>Skeleton Archers</em> in the following room</p>
        <p>Slide through the <em>Spear Guard</em>, grab the <b>Heart Max Up</b> to the left of the <em>Magnes Pin</em> then use <b>the same pin to launch yourself</b> into the next hallway</p>
        <p>From there, continue <b>sliding through enemies</b> until you leave the insides of the Prison</p>
        <p>Video until this point: </p>

        <p>In the <em>second to last room with the demons</em> trigger the <b>Spotlight</b><br>
        Once the <em>Tinman</em> is on screen, hit it with <b>One Macir Union and a Single Jump Attack</b></p>
        <p>Open the <em>Blue Chest</em> for <b>Strength Ring</b> and dash towards the exit</p>
        <p>Open the <em>Yellow Chest</em> for <b>Glyph Sleeve</b>, and if you don't get the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#generalInfo">Text Skip</a>, it's not a huge deal but definitely learn it</p>
        <p>I wanted to isolate the Tinman segment so it's easier to reference: </p>
