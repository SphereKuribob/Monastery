        <h2>Ecclesia - Skeleton Tutorial Room</h2>
        <p>As mentioned in the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#skeleRoom">Skeleton Room Info</a> section, we want to force the Skeletons to spawn in front of Shanoa</p>
        <p>In NMC, we pick up a Heart Max Up in the Monastery, so we can use all of our Unions here</p>
        <p><b>Get a single jump slash on the first Skeleton, then do a grounded Union close to it, hitting the second one as well</b></p>
        <p>If done right, 2 more will spawn infront of Shanoa, and you repeat the sequence</p>
        <p>The key here is how close you do the Union to the Skeletons and remaining grounded as you do</p>
        <p>If done in the air, the Union will miss or cancel early, and if done far away, less of it will hit</p>
        <p>Just make sure you're not too close to the first Skeleton or you risk triggering a spawn behind you</p>

        <p>If you see a <em>Green Chest</em> go for it as well, as it can contain a <b>Heart Refresh</b>, which saves time later in the run</p>
        <p>According to hellagels, Brown Chests have a <b>22.45%</b> chance to drop a Ticket</p>
        <p>Across the usual 3 Chests we grab, this equates to a <b>53.4%</b> chance roughly to at least get <em>1</em></p>

        <p>If any <b>Skeleton Jumps</b> as you approach or slide through it, get hit by them for a good <em>damage boost</em></p>

        <p>Every enemy in the Heart Max Up Room has an RNG spawn, so do your best to damage boost off the Ghosts and Zombies</p>
        <p>Continue right through the area. In the next <em>Vertical Room</em>, if you <b>do not have a Ticket or if it's a Green Chest, go for the chest</b></p>
        <p>I like to jump slash the first two bats then Slide to the chest, be mindful to not backdash <em>into</em> the bat as you leave the section</p>
        <p>As you ascend, grab the <b>Money Bag</b>. The bat shouldn't hit you if you <em>backdash jump</em> over it and land on the bag</p>
        <p>Continue left, using the Zombies and Skeletons to damage boost, and grab the Chest on the way</p>
        <p>Note: if you're getting really unlucky, you can instead quickly go <em>right</em> for another chest, but this is very slow</p>

        <h3>Arthroverta</h2>
        <p>We're going to <em>skip</em> the <b>MP Max Up</b> before the boss</p>
        <p>At the start of the fight <b>I like to jump slash into Arthro</b></p>
        <p>After, if you take a look at the <em>background</em> you want to position yourself infront of Arthro at about the <em>center</em> of that second pillar </p>
        <img src = "ArthrovertaFight.png" alt = "Arthroverta Fight Positioning"/>
        <p>From this position, when you do a <em>Grounded Union</em>, it will hit <b>4 times</b></p>
        <p>The strategy is to <b>Union -> Couple Normal Hits -> Repeat Until 0 Hearts</b><em> before the first roll</em></p>
        <p>Afterwards, spam Confedere until Arthro dies. I like to stand a bit away when landing normal hits, to give room for a <em>slide under the Green Web attack</em></p>
        <p>Also, if you dodge away, it's good practice to close the distance with a <em>jump slash in</em></p>
        <p>Important: when she does her <em>Claw Slam</em>, you can hit her claws too</p>
        <p>Below is the general idea for the fight: </p>
        <img src = "ArthrovertaFightStrategy.png" alt = "Arthroverta Fight Strategy"/>
        <p>If you are struggling to get all your Unions in before the first roll, it's completely fine to space them out after</p>
        <p>Just be mindful to positon yourself close enough to get 4 Union hits in and not take damage</p>

        <h3>Leaving Monastery</h2>
        <p>After the fight, Magnetize on the <b>left pin and hold right</b>. The boss orb will spawn on you</p>
        <p>Hold <em>left</em> after you grab it, <b>release -> land on the right ledge -> immediately slide into the next room</b></p>
        <p>As pointed out to me by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BrookeSpeedruns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LonelySR</a>, sliding into the Albus Cutscene, then skipping the scene stops Shanoa from walking away from the left exit</p>
        <img src="AlbusCutscene.png" alt="Albus Cutscene"/>
        <p>Do the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#instantFling">Instant Flings</a> while exiting left through the boss room</p>
        <p>Go down <b>to the save -> save the game -> then suspend the game</b> to go back to the title screen</p>

        <p>Once in <em>Course 1</em>, perform the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#TicketGlitch">Ticket Glitch</a> immediately</p>
        <p>This will take you to the Village where you want to <em>Save the Game</em></p>

        <h2>Ruvas Forest</h2>
        <p>This is the biggest test of proper Damage Boosting and Magnes Dashing for each run</p>
        <p>I highly recommend watching any of the top three runs do this segment for a better idea, and I will include a video below</p>
        <p>Dash through and Damage Boost off Skeleton Knights until the <b>Torch after the Macir Statue</b>, hitting the statue on the way</p>
        <p>Before the Statue, you can also boost off the <em>Une</em> to get i-frames a bit earlier</p>
        <p>Kill the <em>Nominion (Squid)</em> if it's close and absorb Macir, refreshing you to <b>50 hearts</b></p>
        <p>Video of this: </p>
        <p>From there, watch the video guides/runs to figure out which enemies are best to damage boost off of, but I will list important boosts</p>
        <p>Generally, you want to boost off <em>Necromancers, Skeleton Knights, Axe Armors and Zombies</em></p>
        <p>In the second room, boost off the <em>bat</em> to skip through the 3 Zombies at the start</p>
        <p>You can damage boost off the bones the Skeletons throw, but if RNG is not in your favor, it can lose time so slide through</p>
        <p>Video of this: </p>
        <p>In room three, the <em>first Necromancer</em> gives you i-frames usually until you're inside the next <em>Skeleton Knight after the Une</em></p>
        <p>While in that Knight's hitbox, <b>you can jump to instantly get hit in the air</b></p>
        <p>Video of this:</p>
        <p>Boost through the best you can after until the end and head into Kalidus Channel</p>
        <p>Below is the full segment: </p>

        <p>Also be mindful of your MP here, use <a href = "../General/Gen.html#backdashSection">alternate forms of backdashing</a> when running out</p>

    <section id = "kalidusChannel" class = "kalidusChannel">
        <h2>Kalidus Channel</h2>
        <p>A recent discovery showed that you can <b>dive kick after jumping out of the waterline</b> here to move through a bit faster</p>
        <p>Here's a video of that: </p>
        <p>I don't recommend doing this in rooms with infinitely respawn <em>Sea Stingers (Fish)</em> or ones with Needles as you lose time getting hit</p>
        <p>The general strat here is to <b>jump slash</b> to one shot any <em>Merman</em> here and damage boost off of Needles</p>
        <p>Backdash jump off the boxes and planks as you land on them</p>
        <p>Usually, you're damage boosting off Needles when there's <b>two right next to each other</b> in the <em>room before the save</em></p>
        <p>Here's the same room: </p>
        <p>Make sure to absorb the shopkeeper, bringing you to <b>60 Hearts</b></p>
        <p>You can take the heal in the middle if you want, but we're about to get two free heals so I don't recommend it</p>
        <p>After the save, continue the same movement you've been doing, and if RNG permits, you can even damage boost of <em>the fish</em> for extra speed</p>
        <p>The final room with the <em>Single Merman</em> is where I tend to use the aforementioned<b> Water Divekick Trick</b> since there's nothing else that will hit you</p>

    <section id = "prison" class = "prison">
        <h2>Minera Prison Island</h2>
        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>I'll split this segment's videos into 3 short parts then a final full one at the end</p>
        <p>Once you reach the boss door, equip <b>Macir on both hands</b>, also, you can <b>press Start to instantly leave the equip or item menu</b></p>
        <p>Do 4x <a href = "../General/Gen.html#unionCancel">Macir Union Cancels</a> to kill Giant Skeleton</p>
        <p>It should be fast enough to where the Orb spawns below the Magnes Pin, so you can grab it while Magentized then launch yourself to the exit  </p>
        <p>Next two rooms you want to damage boost off of the <em>Spear Guards</em> and <em>Skeleton Archers</em></p>
        <p>Important to note for the Spear Guards is that sometimes they can <em>thrust their Spears up</em>, causing heavy knockback if it hits you <br>
        To avoid this, <b>slow down your backdashes as you approach them then jump over and get hit like normal</b></p>
        <p>Also, usually an <em>Evil Force (Giant Head)</em> spawns, which is a useful damage boost as it flies low to the ground, so you can just <b>shorthop into it without turning around for i-frames</b></p>
        <p>In the following rooms, <b>backdash jump</b> up any stairs, <b>slide through the enemies in the inner hallways</b>, and <b>backdash/slide off any ledeges</b> in descending rooms</p>
        <p>There's a <em>Skeleton Archer</em> in the first descending room. If you hear it <em>drawing its bow</em> wait on the <b>raised platform</b>, otherwise keep going</p>
        <p>Video up until this point: </p>

        <h3>Middle</h3>
    
        <p>Damage boost off the <em>Spear Guard through the Invisible Man</em><b> <br>Ignore the HP Max Up</b> and damage boost off of the Archers in the <em>Guillotine Room</em> to get to Albus</p>
        <p>In the Albus Room, backdash to the <b>second to last tile on the ground, then absorb the glyph</b> don't go too far or you trigger some text</p>
        <p>Backdash out of that room and <b>through the first Iron Maiden, sliding under the second one</b> before <b>grabbing the Money at the end</b></p>
        <p>Ascend, and <b>in the next room, damage boost off the <em>Invisible Man</em> to backdash through the <em>Creature</em></b></p>
        <p>Use <b>jump attacks as you ascend with Macir</b> to one shot the <em>Skeleton Archers</em> in the following room</p>
        <p>Slide through the <em>Spear Guard</em>, grab the <b>Heart Max Up</b> to the left of the <em>Magnes Pin</em> then use <b>the same pin to launch yourself</b> into the next hallway</p>
        <p>From there, continue <b>sliding through enemies</b> until you leave the insides of the Prison</p>
        <p>Video until this point: </p>

        <h3>End</h3>
        <p>In the <em>second to last room with the demons</em> trigger the <b>Spotlight</b><br>
        Once the <em>Tinman</em> is on screen, hit it with <b>One Macir Union and a Single Jump Attack</b></p>
        <p>Open the <em>Blue Chest</em> for <b>Strength Ring</b> and dash towards the exit</p>
        <p>Open the <em>Yellow Chest</em> for <b>Glyph Sleeve</b>, and if you don't get the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#generalInfo">Text Skip</a>, it's not a huge deal but definitely learn it</p>
        <p>I wanted to isolate the Tinman segment so it's easier to reference: </p>

        <h2>Second Boss Rush Segment</h2>
        <h3>Pre-Boss Rush</h3>
        <p>This part is a bit complex, so definitely watch the videos alongside reading this for more clarity</p>
        <p>After exiting the Prison, return to the Village and buy the<b> Maximum Amount of Tickets then use the rest on Meat</b></p>
        <p>Fully refresh your hearts, save and use the DC Menu to reset the game</p>
        <p>Go to Course 1, on one sleeve, equip <b>Double Confedere and Magnes</b></p>
        <p>On the second sleeve, equip <b>Double Dominus Hatred and Magnes</b></p>
        <p>Finally, <b>equip Strength Ring</b></p>
        <p>Go through the portal</p>

        <h3>Arthroverta</h3>
        <p>Use <b>Hatred Twice</b> then a <b>Puff Union</b></p>
        <p>Backdash into the portal</p>
        <img src = "NMC.png" />

        <h3>Crab</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, we can't use <a href = "../Any/Any.html#">Crab Skip</a> here, so we got a boring fight ahead</p>
        <p>Get to the top, and stay on the <b>bottom right or left platform at the top</b>, you won't get hit by Crab's ascent here</p>
        <p>Just spam <em>Regular Macir Attacks</em>, we do enough damage to instant phase transition with normal attacks </p>
        <p>In <em>Red Phase</em>, I recommend hugging the <em>right wall</em> to force it to hit the same ceiling spot 3 times</p>
        <p>After the crack, hit the claw as much as you can</p>
        <p>Repeat this twice, and make sure it targets the <em>pre-existing</em> cracks in the ceiling like normal</p>
        <p>After the third ceiling break, you can either <b>take damage to go through claw and launch up to the elevator</b> <br>
        or do <a href = "../General/Gen.html#Claw Skip">Claw Skip</a></p>
        <p>Make sure you hit down on the Elevator on the <b>right side</b></p>

        <h3>Man-Eater</h3>
        <p>This one is a bit tricky, but you want to one-shot this with <b>Double Hatred</b>, so switch to that sleeve</p>
        <p>The image below shows the general spot you wanna stand at for this</p>
        <img src = "maneater.png" />
        <p>This is crucial, <b>as the tentacles come out, use Double Hatred</b>, it should die before its tentacles fully extend outward</p>
        <p>Refer to the video for a clearer visual: </p>
        <img src = "maneaterTentacle.mov"/>
        <p>Slide into the portal</p>

        <h3>Rusalka</h3>
        <p>I do a <b>jump slash in then a single grounded union</b></p>
        <p>After that, you just do normal attacks till she dies. I try to take advantage of the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#generalInfo">Hair Spike Manip</a></p>
        <p>This helps kill her in the center of the room, so you can quickly <b>grab the orb and go through the protal</b></p>

        <h3>Goliath</h3>
        <p>Fun fight here, and all credit goes to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/smithp226" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smith</a> for these strats </p>
        <p>Backdash in, turn around and do <b>Double Hatred into Puff Union</b>, avoid an attack if Goliath does one, then do the <b>same attack sequence again</b></p>
        <p>This is enough damage to make Goliath crouch, allowing you to also <b>crouch at his toes and start spamming Confedere</b> (found by Halgorithm)</p>
        <p>Use your <b>High Mind Up</b> after a couple attacks since you'll be out of MP</p>
        <p>Keep attacking, <b>when Goliath gets up, stand and use a Confedere Union</b>, make sure his hand is <b>fully extended</b> so it doesn't hit you</p>
        <p>Do a couple more attacks, and <b>as he's crouching, use your final union</b></p>
        <p>He'll die after a few more attacks</p>
        <p><a href = "../General/Gen.html#TicketM">Magical Ticket Glitch</a> out when the fight is over</p>

        <h3>Post-Boss Movement</h3>
        <p>Heal at the save, then head to the <b>Lighthouse</b></p>
        <p>Dash through and <a href = "../General/Gen.html#instantFling">Instant Fling</a> over the spikes</p>
        <p>We want to grab <b>Serpent Scale</b> here then go back to the <em>Elevator Room</em> and through the portal</p>
        <p>Go left to grab <b>Double Jump</b>. You can <b>Slide into the Giant Skeleton for i-frames</b> to grab the chest<br>There's also a small area infront of it where you can open the chest but its riskier</br></p>
        <p>Go right and through the portal, and dash to the <b>right exit of Somnus Reef</b></p>
        <p>In the first <em>vertical room</em>, travel on the left side and use your <b>last 5 hearts for a Puff Union on the Decarabia</b></p>
        <p>Use <b>Hatred</b> for the rest of the <em>Decarabias</em> and leave right</p>
        <p>Go to Lighthouse and enter through the <b>Bottom Exit</b> and go to the portal</p>
        <p>Keep using it until you get to <b>Goliath's Room</b>, then head to the save and save before resetting and loading the <b>Main Save</b></p>

        <p>Go down like normal, and in the <em>Giant Skeleton</em> room, I recommend doing the same</p>
        <p>Grab <b>Vol Grando</b> from the waterfall. I like to <a href = "../General/Gen.html#instantFling">Instant Fling</a> to it then back to edge before sliding off</p>
        <p>Hold left as you fall down the waterfall then <b>wait a bit before using your double jump to land at the Red Chest to get the Hearts</b><br>
        This heart grab is a bit tricky, definitely watch the runs to see how people do the jump</p>
        <p>In the <em>Spike Room</em>, hit the bat then <b>>Instant Fling across</b>. There's a TAS strat here, which I will discuss more in Glitchless</p>
        <p>In the <em>Ectoplasm room</em>, try to avoid them, you can use <b>Hatred</b> to kill them if needed</p>
        <p>The next vertical room, <b>Dive Kick on the <em>right side</em> of the <em>Second Lizard Man</em>, wait till <em>the apex</em> of the kick to Double Jump on the platform</b></p>
        <p>Divekick off the next <em>Lizard Man</em>. If done right, an <em>Altair</em> should spawn perfectly for you to kick off that and ascend efficiently</p>
        <p>From there, just dash to the left through any enemies</p>
        <p>At the <em>Glyph Statue</em>, <b>reload the room</b> absorb the Vol Hasta<br>I don't recommend grabbing it without reloading since we don't have <b>Tower Ring</b></br></p>
        <p>Then just dash to the left exit to <em>Oblivion Ridge</em>. Remember to use <a href = "../General/Gen.html#backdashSection">alternate forms of backdashing</a> when low on MP here <br>
        Also, if you get hit by the <em>Ectoplasms</em>, it's not a big deal. Just keep ascending and ignore the save since the <b>Curse debuff wears off at the top anyway</b> </p>

        <h3>Oblivion Ridge</h3>
        <p><a href = "../General/Gen.html#damageBoost">Damage Boost</a> through the first room. You may have to watch your MP here</p>
        <p>Take the <b>save heal</b>, dash to the boss room</p>

        <h3>The Gravedorcus Quick Kill</h3>
        <p>There's multiple ways to do this, but I'll outline how I do it</p>
        <p>Briefly wait to trigger <b>Grave's Jump Attack</b>, then <b>slide off the right</b></p>
        <p>Do a <b>Double Hatred Cast</b> when he's above you, and wait for him to surface to the right</p>
        <p>As he surfaces, <b>use a Puff Union -> Double Hatred Cast -> Backdash</b></p>
        <p>You want to do this quick since being this close to him will trigger his <b>Poison Breath</b> if you don't get away fast enough</p>
        <p>During the backdash, <b>Go to Equipment Menu -> Macir Sleeve -> Replace 1 Macir with Vol Grando -> Exit Menu</b></p>
        <p>Quickly, <a href ="../General/Gen.html#attackUnion">Grando + Macir Union Cancel</a> until <em>0 Hearts</em>, <b>crouch infront of him as he digs, then Double Hatred Cast</b></p>
        <p>Other runners do this slightly different, so try them out and do what works for you</p>
        <p>If Gravedorcus surfaces <b>left of you after the start</b>, you can do the same thing but you need to adjust your positioning so that the Union doesn't <b>ghost hit</b></p>
        <p>If you fail the end of this, it's not a big deal, he should be 2-4 regular hits away from death</p>

        <h3>Exiting Oblivion Ridge</h3>
        <p>You can <b>Dive Kick over the plant or dash through it</b>, then continue left and <a href = "../General/Gen.html#damageBoost">Damage Boost</a> through </p>
        <p>Enter the room -> skip the cutscenes -> <em>Magical Ticket </em>out</p>
        <p>Head to <em>Ecclesia</em> scale up as you did at the start of the game and trigger the <em>Barlowe Cutscene</em> by entering his room</p>
        <p>Skip it -> <b>Magical Ticket Glitch</b> to ticket out</p>

        <h2>To Barlowe</h2>
        <h3>Argila Swamp</h3>
        <p>Not much to say here. Just <a href = "../General/Gen.html#damageBoost">Damage Boost</a> through</p>
        <p>For the <em>Choses Unes</em> <b>dive kick on the right side of them to avoid trading hits</b></p>
        <p>Kick over and dash through the <em>Knights and Plants</em> here</p>

        <h2>Mystery Manor</h2>
        <p>Quickly go to <em>Kalidus</em> <b>top left entrance and </b> grab the <b>Heart Max Up</b> at the bottom of the water next to the <em>Killer Fish</em></p>
        <p>Back to <em>Manor</em>, <a href = "../General/Gen.html#damageBoost">Damage Boost</a> through the enemies</p>
        <p>When you get to the room with the <em>Head and Fomor</em> <b>boost off the head</b></p>
        <p>Dash to the save and <b>save the game</b> after replacing your <b>Double Confedere Sleeve with Double Vol Hasta and Double Hatred with Anger</b></p>

        <h3>Albus Fight One</h3>
        <p>Open the fight by dashing to <em>Albus</em></p>
        <p><b>3 Anger Casts -> Puff -> Dash behind him as he runs away -> 3 Anger Casts -> <a href ="../General/Gen.html#attackUnion">Grando + Macir Union Cancel</a> until he's dead</b></p>
        <p>If you mess up the <b>Anger Casts, you might need to use some regular Vol Hasta attacks to finish him</b></p>
        <p>I think you can fit in an extra <b>Puff Union</b> as well if needed after the second set of <b>Angers</b></p>

        <h3>Bad Ending Trigger</h3>
        <p>Absorb <b>Dominus Agony</b>, skip the <em>Barlowe Cutscene</em>, then <a href = "../General/Gen.html#TicketM">Magical Ticket Glitch</a> out</p>
        <p>Regenerate your hearts and heal if needed, most likely needed unless u want to go slow in Manor</p>
        <p>Make you way back to <b>Albus' Boss Room -> Skip the Cutscene -> Ticket Out -> Go to Barlowe's Room -> Equip All Three Dominus Pieces then Union to trigger Bad Ending</b></p>
        <p>Skip the cutscene then watch the <b>Bad Ending</b></p>

        <h3>Albus Fight Two</h3>
        <p>Requip <b>Double Anger</b> then dash into the room and to <em>Albus</em> and do the <b>Triple Anger Casts -> Puff Union</b></p>
        <p>Dash behind him again as he runs away, do a <b>Hasta Union</b> then start finishing him off with regular <em>Vol Hasta</em> hits</p>
        <p>If he jumps away, follow him to keep up the damage</p>
        <p>You can also bait his <b>Flame Kicks</b> to him in place</p>
        <p>Do not go below <b>75 Hearts</b></p>

        <h3>Barlowe Fight</h3>
        <p>Equip <b>Dominus Agony on your Macir + Grando Sleeve</b> </p>
        <p><a href ="../General/Gen.html#attackUnion">Grando + Macir Union Cancel</a> with <b>Dominus Agony</b> on and kill Barlowe</p>
        <p>You should have just enough hearts to kil him</p>
        <p>Before ticketing out, I recommend replacing <b>Agony with Magnes</b> to make killing <em>Cats</em> later easier</p>
        <p>Regen to about <b>30/40</b> then heal and leave for the Castle. You can skip this heal if you're willing to take a risk and wait for the Castle entrance save</p>
        <p>Time for RNG</p>

    <section class = "castle" id = "castle">
        <h2>Castle</h2>
        <h3>Cat Segment</h3>
        <p>Skip the cutscene and dash through the entrance, making sure to <b>conserve your MP</b></p>
        <p>Divekick through the hallway enemies, <b>don't get poisoned</b>. Divekicking over Ghouls follows the same principles as the <a href = "#toBarlowe">Chosen Unes</a></p>
        <p>In the first big room, we encounter <em>Arma Felix</em>, a crucial enemy for this run as we need its <b>Glyph Drop</b></p>
        <p>Use <b>Vol Grando and Macir regular attacks</b> to clear out the <em>Peeping Eyes and Fleamen</em>, and <a href ="../General/Gen.html#attackUnion">Grando + Macir Union Cancel</a> to kill the <em>Cats</em> here</p>
        <p>Ideally, you get the drop in this room, but it's a <b>4.7% chance individually and a 41% chance across the total we kill</b>, according to Halgorithm</p>
        <p>I will say, when I got my PB, it was more uncommon for me to straight up never get one</p>
        <p>Grab the <b>Heart Max Up</b> before leaving the big room, and in the next vertical room with the <em>Blood Skeletons</em>, grab the <b>Tasty Meat</b></p>
        <p>Continue to <em>Wallman</em>, killing any <em>Felixes</em> on the way <b>if you have not gotten the drop yet</b></p>
        <p>Some people grind the drop in the HP Max Up, <b>DO NOT DO THIS</b>. Grinding early when you still have <b>3 kills</b> on the way is not optimal</p>
        <p>Also some useful tech before Wallman's room is to <b>divekick off the Fomor to get up to the boss door</b></p>
        <p><a href = "../General/Gen.html#wallman">Kill Wallman</a>, then replace your <b>Anger Sleeve with Double Vol Hasta + Paries</b></p>
        <p>There are <b>2 more cats after Wallman</b>, and if you don't end up getting one, you can grind the last one next to the <em>Peeping Eye</em> (or just reset honestly)</p>

        <h3>Nitesco</h3>
        <p>After the last cat, we want to take the <b>right path to Forsaken Cloister</b></p>
        <p>Dash/Damage boost through, using the <em>Fomors</em> for i-frames</p>
        <p>Grab the <b>Warp to the left of the area exit before continuing right to Cloister</b></p>
        <p>If you have spare hearts, <b>kill the Cave Trolls with Macir + Grando Union</b> otherwise <br>
        <b>Slide under the first and Vol Hasta the next</b></p>
        <p>Absorb <b>Nitesco from the first <em>Nova Skeleton</em></b>, then Magical Ticket out</p>
        <p>Regenerate your hearts, save and reset</p>

    <section class = "finalBossRush" id = "finalBossRush">
        <h2>Final Boss Rush</h2>
        <p>Go to <b>Course 1 then <a href = "../General/Gen.html#TicketM">Magical Ticket Glitch</a> out </b></p>
        <p>Dash to the save <b>Equipment Menu -> Replace Vol Grando with Nitesco and add Dominus Agony -> Replace Double Hasta with Nitesco and add Arma Felix -> Save -> Reset</b></p>
        <p>Go to <b>Course 2, you should now be Albus</b></p>

        <h3>Blackmore</h3>
        <p>Go through the portal</p>
        <p>A quirk with this glitched state is we can use <b>Felix by pressing X and Nitesco with R</b>, buttons might be swapped depending on controller</p>
        <p><b>Jump in -> Optical Shot -> Nitesco -> Land -> Flame Kick Right and Get Hit -> Optical Shot -> Nitesco -> Go Under During Phase Transtion -> Neutral Flame Kick</b></p>
        <p>Try for this sequence of attacks and adapt based on his pattern, ideally he should not slam or lunge forward</p>
        <p>The fight shouldn't be longer than <b>15 seconds, ideally under 10</b></p>
        <p><b>Do not go below 90 Hearts</b></p>

        <h3>Eligor</h3>
        <p><b>High jump -> Teleport onto His Back -> Press X to transform into Felix -> Untransform to become Shanoa</b></p>
        <p><b>Turn on Agony -> <a href ="../General/Gen.html#attackUnion">4x Nitesco + Macir Union Cancels -> When Dead, Turn off Agony -> Backdash Off -> Dive Kick to Portal</a></b></p>
        <p>When teleporting onto <em>Eligor</em>, teleport to the <b>space between his sword and body then to his back</b></p>

        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>Turn on Agony -> <a href ="../General/Gen.html#attackUnion">2x Nitesco + Macir Union Cancels </a>-> Backdash Away -> Replace Arma Felix with Agony on Double Nitesco Page </p>
        <p><b>Heal to 400 HP or Greater -> Start Killing Death with Regular Nitesco Lasers + Agony -> When Dead Replace Agony with Magnes -> <a href = "../General/Gen.html#TicketM">Magical Ticket Glitch</a> out </b></p>
        <p>You currently have <b>Moonwalkers</b> equipped, so use that to backdash through any unavoidable attacks like his <em>Scythe Trap</em></p>
        <p>If you got a <b>Heart Refresh</b> at the start of the game, use it after those <b>first 2 Unions during the heal menu</b>, then use the extra hearts for Unions</p>

        <h3>To Volaticus</h3>
        <p>Take the heal at Village -> Go to Castle -> Warp to <b>Forsaken Cloister's Entrance</b></p>
        <p>With <b>Moonwalkers</b> our <a href = "../General/Gen.html#magnes">Magnes Dashes</a> will be faster and have i-frames, so use it to dash through enemies till the <em>Cerberus Gate</em></p>
        <p>The Boss Rush glitch opened the gate for us, so we can just ascend it. Make sure to grab the <b>Eisbein at the top</b></p>
        <p>Enter Final Approach, since we're still in boss rush we can take a lot more hits on our way to <b>Volaticus</b> so be liberal with the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#damageBoost">Damage Boosts</a>  </p>
        <p>Kill <em>Imps</em> if they're in you're way as their debuff will cost you a lot of time, use <b>Nitesco on the <em>Ruler Swords</em></b> to not get hit</p>
        <p>In the second room, you can sometimes <b>divekick off the <em>Imps</em> then kick the <em>Lizardman</em> to get over them, otherwise boost off the <em>Imps</em></b></p>
        <p>Continue left by sliding under the <em>Cave Troll</em>, dive kicking over the <em>Succubus</em>, and boosting through<em>Final Knights</em></p>
        <p>Fall down to <b>Volaticus</b>, absorb it, and equip it on your <b>Double Hasta Page</b></p>

        <h3>To Dracula</h3>
        <p>Fly up to the <b>ceiling room</b>, use double Hasta to kill the <em>Bugbears</em> and grab the <b>MP Max Up</b> in the <em>rightmost Red Chest</em> </p>
        <p>Leave and fly right to the double <em>Final Knight</em> room and dash through them again. You should use your <b>Eisbein</b> here</p>
        <p>In the <em>Cavetroll</em> room, slide under the first one,</br></p>
        <p>One the second level of this room, do a <b>Jump Union</b> to kill the next 2 above you and freely dash to the next room</p>
        <p>Boost through the <em>Devil and Final Knights</em>, <b>use Unions to kill the 2 <em>Devils</em> before the big room</b></p>
        <p>Grab <b>Judgment Ring in the breakable wall to the right</b> in the final big room, then make your way left while killing the <em>Devil</em> with your last few hearts</p>
        <p>Grab the <b>Heart Max Up</b> -> <b>divekick</b> off the <em>Bugbear</em> -> Dash through the <em>Devil</em> and <em>Skeleton Blaze</em> then <b>fly up to the save before Dracula</b></p>
        <p>If you need to kill the enemies after the Heart Max Up, use normal <b>Double Nitesco</b> attacks</p>
        <p>Finally, <b>save before Dracula and reset to load the main save</b></p>

        <h2>Dracula</h2>
        <p>On the Double <em>Nitesco</em> equip page, <b>equip Dominus Agony</b></p>
        <p>Equip <b>all three Dominus Pieces</b> on the <em>Volaticus</em> page then equip <b>Strength Ring and Judgement Ring</b></p>
        <p>Enter the fight -> skip the cutscene -><a href ="../General/Gen.html#attackUnion">Agony and Nitesco + Macir Union Cancel until 0 Hearts</a> -> <b>Agony and Regular Nitesco Lasers</b> until he dies</p>
        <p>Switch to the <b>Dominus Page</b> and end the run with the Union</p>
        <p>Congratulations, you finished your first NMC run!</p>
        <p>Also, I like going to the <b>left of Dracula</b> to do my Unions, but only because it's easier for me to cancel in that direction</p>
