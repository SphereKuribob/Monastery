        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I will highlight key points of the run starting with the Skeleton tutorial room</p>
        <p>For further information regarding the first two rooms of the game, visit the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#tutorialSegment">tutorial</a> section</p>
    </section>

    <section class = "Skeleton" id = "SkeletonRoom">
        <h2>Ecclesia - Skeleton Tutorial Room</h2>
        <p>As mentioned in the <a href = "../General/Gen.html#skeleRoom">Skeleton Room Info</a> section, we want to force the Skeletons to spawn in front of Shanoa</p>
        <p>In NMC, we pick up a Heart Max Up in the Monastery, so we can use all of our Unions here</p>
        <p><b>Get a single jump slash on the first Skeleton, then do a grounded Union close to it, hitting the second one as well</b></p>
        <p>If done right, 2 more will spawn infront of Shanoa, and you repeat the sequence</p>
        <p>The key here is how close you do the Union to the Skeletons and remaining grounded as you do</p>
        <p>If done in the air, the Union will miss or cancel early, and if done far away, less of it will hit</p>
        <p>Just make sure you're not too close to the first Skeleton or you risk triggering a spawn behind you</p>

    <section class = "eccMon" id = "eccMon">
        <h2>Monastery</h2>
        <p>Confedere Cancel out of the Skeleton Room and slide off the ledges/jump to cancel you fall end lag to exit Ecclesia</p>
        <p>Confedere Cancel through the entrance of the Monastery, near the end of the outside area you'll run out of MP so use <a href ="../General/Gen.html#backdashSection">other forms of BDC</a>.</p>

        <h3>Monastery Skeleton Room</h3>
        <p>If the first Skeleton throws a bone, jump above it then <a href = "../General/Gen.html#damageBoost">damage boost</a> off the bone to get knocked past it</p>
        <p>BDC to the next Skeleton and damage boost off of it then jump over the next</p>
        <p>Finally, damage boost off the next Skeleton's bone or body to get through the end of the room</p>
        <p>It is RNG if they throw a bone at the right time or not, so be prepared to alternate between what you're boosting off</p>
