            <h2>Backdash Canceling</h2>
            <p>This movement is a crucial part of every Castlevania game, and Ecclesia is no exception</p>
            <p>We have a huge variety too! Traditional jump cancels, rolling backdashes, Scutum Dashing, and most importantly Magnes Dashing</p>       
            <p>Moonwalkers make this movement even better which we see in the Magical Ticket Routes and Randomizers</p>
            <p>This is because it extends your backdash and also provides i-frames, which if timed correctly, can give you permanent i-frames</p>

            <h3>Jump Backdash Cancel</h3>
            <p>The simplest form of backdashing and can be done as soon as the game starts</p>
            <p><b>Turn around -> Backdash -> Short hop at the end -> Turn around -> Repeat</b></p>
            <p>This technique is great for when you're out of MP, going up inclines, or dodging</p>
            <p>There are almost always far better options though</p>

        <div class = "rollDash" id = "rollDash">
            <h3>Rolling Backdash Cancel</h3>
            <p>From what I know, this was found by Halgorithm when they were experimenting with Dawn of Sorrow</p>
            <p><b>Backdash -> Down -> Up -> Repeat </b></p>
            <p>The above series of input needs to be done quick and at a steady rhythm</p>
            <p>This is faster than jump canceling, and is great with Moonwalkers or Albus</p>
            <p>It is easy on keyboard, and from what I've seen is possible on controller as well</p>
            <p>This method is also very effective with the extended backdash the transformation glyphs have</p>

        <div class = "weaponCanceling" id = "weaponCanceling">
            <h3>Weapon Canceling</h3>
            <p>This is what you're predominantly going to use before you get Magnes</p>
            <p><b>Attack -> Backdash -> Repeat</b></p>
            <p>This is commonly used with Confedere, and you can do the same with Albus' Agartha</p>
            <p>For some weapons like Macir, Ascia, and Hasta, you need to alternate which hand you do the initial attack with (X or Y)</p>
            <p>To be more technical, you backdash about 2-3 frames after the attack</p>
            <p>Other INT based glyphs with longer animations aren't as effective to cancel</p>

        <div class = "scutumCancel" id = "scutumCancel">
            <h3>Scutum Dash/Shield Dash</h3>
            <p>Right out of SOTN, we can Shield Dash in Ecclesia as well</p>
            <p><b>Backdash -> Scutum</b></p>
            <p>It's basically just like weapon canceling, but Scutum has no end lag and the animation does not persist, making it the second fastest</p>
            <p>This is primarily used as an alternative for controller players in Glitchless or during the randomizer</p>
            <p>The added benefit of Scutum is if you hold up at any point during your backdashes, you can use the i-frame Union simultaneously</p>
            <p>The MP usage here is very high</p>

            <h3>Magnes Dashing</h3>
            <p>This is the main form of movement in every run</p>
            <p><b>Magnes + Backdash</b></p>
            <p>Technically, you backdash about 1-2 frames before using Magnes, but if you mash them together it will work</p>
            <p>You have no constraint on how fast you can mash, so in some categories, you generally want to go as fast as you can</p>
            <p>Keep in mind however that your MP will drain faster at high mashing speeds, so in Glitchless especially it's important to be mindful of your use</p>
            <p>It is recommended for controller players to have a keyboard on standby for this technique as it is basically free on keyboard and simultaneous bindings are banned</p>

            <h2>Damage Boosting</h2>
            <p>This is a crucial part of Ecclesia movement used in every run</p>
            <p>When Shanoa gets hit in the air, she has prolonged i-frames that we can take advantage of with the aforementioned <a href = "#backdashSection">backdash</a> techniques</p>
            <p><b>Basically, you want to purposefully get hit while in the air to knock Shanoa in the direction you're trying to go, and then backdash through enemies in your way with the added i-frames</b></p>
            <p>A good way to do this is to jump over the enemy you want to get hit by, once you cross it, turn around while still airborne and then get hit</p>
            <p>Not only will this give you the i-frames, but the knockback will send you in the direction you want to go while also turning Shanoa around, setting her up for backdashes</p>
            <p>You can also purposefully backdash shorthop into an enemy if you're close to one</p>
            <p>This will knock you forward, but the shorthop shortens that distance and you can take advantage of the i-frames from there</p>

            <h2>Attack and Union Cancels</h2>
            <p>As is Castlevania tradition, attack cancels are important for Order of Ecclesia speedruns</p>
            <p>Generally, normal attacks are already fast enough with the basic hand swapping, so we usually aren't jump canceling like other IGAvanias</p>
            <p>However, jump canceling can still be effective for moving while attacking or slower Glyphs</p>
            <p><b>Short hop -> Attack</b></p>
            <p>You can backdash to cancel attack end lag as well</p>

            <h2>Union Cancels</h2>
            <p>The main damage dealer, Unions can be canceled with jumps and backdashes like attacks</p>
            <p>Every run uses them for quick kills to some degree, so it's important to learn this</p>
            <h3>First method is with jumps</h3>
            <p><b>Attack + Up -> Backdash -> Jump</b></p>
            <p>Since the backdash moves you away from the enemy, I like to hold forward as I do this sequence, or press forward as I am landing</p>
            <h3>Second method is with crouching</h3>
            <p><b>Attack + Up -> Backdash -> Crouch</b></p>
            <p>This is <em>faster</em> than the jump method since you don't have to wait for Shanoa to land</p>
            <p>It's a bit more tricky to reposition yourself after a single sequence as incorporating the forward input might be harder</p>
            <p>Below are examples of both tricks on different bosses, and the Glitchless run will delve into specifics</p>

            <h2>Instant Magnes Fling</h2>
            <p><b>While holding forward near a Magnes pin, if you just tap Magnes (R), you can instantly shoot yourself forward</b></p>
            <p>This is a minor trick that some top runners haven't implemented, but it's a good, simple timesave, especially for Glitchless Tymeo Mountains</p>
            <p>Below are two use cases</p>

            <h2>Redire Movement</h2>
            <p>This is crucial for the end of Glitchless and the Randomizer</p>
            <p><b>With Redire and Magnes equipped: Attack + Magnes, and hold Magnes depending on how long you want magentize yourself</b></p>
            <p>For basic horizontal movement, you can essentially just tap Magnes and interchange the attack button being used <b>(X+R) -> (Y+R) -> (repeat)</b></p>
            <p>For vertical movement, you want to hold Magnes as the blade rises and release Magnes at its apex</p>
            <p>For going around ledges, you want to throw your blade under the ledge, hold magnes until it wraps around then let go once you're above it</p>
            <p>Overall, the duration you hold Magnes varies depending on how far you want to go, the direction, and the fling strength</p>
            <p>Important to note that regular Magnes pins take priority, so you can swing into them then fling from there</p>
            <p>Below is a sequence vertical, horizontal, ledge movements - The Glitchless guide will show more of this</p>

            <h3>Redire and Backdash</h3>
            <p>Pointed out to me by <a href = "https://www.twitch.tv/apple_for_you" target = "_blank">Apple</a>, if you backdash at the start of a Redire throw, Shanoa won't be animation locked and you can freely jump, divekick, or slide during the fling</p>
            <p><b>Redire + Magnes -> Backdash at the very start of the fling to preserve momentum</b></p>
            <p>You generally have to do this while crouching otherwise Shanoa tends to rise from a standing Redire throw, making backdashing tricky</p>
            <p>This is useful in Glitchless for changing your direction during the Redire segment and for the Castle entrance zip</p>

            <p>Found by <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@halgorithm1" target = "_blank">Halgorithm</a>, this glitch allows us to use a Magical Ticket anywhere</p>
            <p><b>Hover over a use item in the menu next to the Magical Ticket, press OK then the direction towards the ticket 1 frame later</b></p>
            <p>This is the cornerstone of the routing involved in NMC and Any%, used to leave boss rush and cutscenes</p>
            <p>It's a bit tricky to select the use item then hit a direction a frame later, but failing costs very little time, so just keep spamming the input sequence until you get it</p>

        <div class = "Hyper" id = "hspeed">
            <h2>Hyperspeed Movement</h2>
            <p>Also found by Halgorithm, this involves using memory corruption in boss rush to change the physics of Shanoa, making her go absurdly fast</p>
            <p>This is easier to explain in a video, but I will try to in text</p>
            <p><b>You need to go into the <em>Map Screen</em> in boss rush -> move the <em>off-screen pin</em> -> <br> press left to make 5 pins appear -> select and hold the <em>third pin</em> -> <br> back out of the map screen as you hold -> enter the map screen again -> then move the pin to the correct position</b></p>
            <p>There are two, crucial positions here, both leading to two different hyperspeed physics</p>
            <p>Once activated, Shanoa will have altered physics, allowing her to zip to various positions and walk on air</p>
            <p>You <em>cannot save</em> with hyperspeed active;You must use a transormation glyph to cancel it</p>
            <p>Backdashing, sliding, attacking, and most actions that aren't moving left and right are not affected by Hyperspeed</p>
            <p>Dragonblitz has an interview with Halgorithm explaining this in further detail, and the Any% guide will delve into this trick's uses more</p>
            <p>The Any% section will discuss other uses of memory corruption using the pins</p>

        <h3>Rusalka Spike Manip</h3>
        <p>There's a specific spot where you can crouch infront of her that makes Rusalka always do her hair spike </p>
        <p>This spot also allows both of your Confedere hands to hit</p>
        <p>The picture will show it clearer, but from the center, I tend to use the <b>tiny rock to the left of her</b></p>
        <p>I crouch in the center of that rock</p>
